# Challenge 4

Our informant got tired of creating ZIP files and corrupting them. Our informant
got the idea from a colleague to let you connect to a server he/she set up. You
need to connect to this server and send it a message.
The message should be a tuple with the first value the atom :secret and second
your process ID so the server can answer back. The server called
`challenge4@10.31.1.161` and expects the cookie to be the key from the previous
challenge. You can send messages to the secret function named `Challenge4.secret()`.
