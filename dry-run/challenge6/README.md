# Challenge 6

Everything is comming together. Our informant is finishing up the server and added
our secret emoji language for communcation. 

The final key is broken in two parts. The first part is a key with the length of seven
characters. Instead of sending a plain number, like we did in the previous challenge,
we need to encode it in our emoji language.

If you finally got the first part send it, encoded in emoji language, in a tuple
with your process ID. The rest will be given to you.

You can find the slow server for communication at `challenge6@10.31.161` and the
secret function is `Challenge6.secret()`.
