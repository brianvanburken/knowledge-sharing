# Challenge 5

Our informant is satisfied with our communication through the server. Though, the
informant decided to ramp up security a bit and only send messages in parts. We
need to connect to his new server `challenge5@10.31.1.161` and set the cookie to
the key we retrieved from the previous server. You need to get a key with the
length of `20` characters. The server expects a new message protocol. You need

to send it the index of the new key you want and it needs your process ID to send
a message back. This all needs to be placed in order in a tuple.

In our final message from our informant we also got some information which
described that the informant needed to reduce costs for pilatus lessons. So we
are dealing with a cheaper service that has a delay of exactly five seconds. But,
on the bright side we can send is many request at once. Maybe, we should send it
parallel requests? It's up to you. You can send it all to the secret
`Challenge5.secret()` function.
