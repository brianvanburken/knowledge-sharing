# Challenge 5

Our informant, satisfied with our communication through the server, decided to
ramp up security a bit and only send messages in parts. We need to connect to his
new server `challenge5@10.31.1.161` and set the cookie to the key we retrieved
from the previous server. You need to get a key with the length of `20`
characters. The server expects a new message protocol. You need to send it the
index of the new key you want and it needs your process ID to send a message
back. Place values both values in a tuple in that order.

In our final message from our informant, we also got some information which
described that the informant needed to reduce costs for pilates lessons. So we
are dealing with a cheaper service that has a delay some small delay. But,
on the bright side we, can send is many requests at once. Maybe, we should send
it parallel requests? It's up to you. You can send it all to the secret
`Challenge5.secret()` function.
