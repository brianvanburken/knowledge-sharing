# Knowledge sharing

This repository contains my blogposts and talks I've given or want to give. The
goal here is to let the public view my talks and give feedback. That way these
talks can be given multiple times (if still relevant).

## Giving feedback

If you've found typos make a PR to fix. For discussions about the content make
an issue.
