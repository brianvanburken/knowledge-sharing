# Challenge 6

Everything is coming together. Our informant is finishing up the server and added
our secret emoji language for communication. 

The informant broke the final key into two parts. The first part is a key with
the length of seven characters. Instead of sending a plain number, as we did
in the previous challenge, we need to encode it in our emoji language. If you
finally got the first part, send it, encoded in emoji language, a tuple with
the key and your process ID. The rest will be given to you.

You can find the slow server for communication at `challenge6@10.31.161` and the
secret function is `Challenge6.secret()`.
