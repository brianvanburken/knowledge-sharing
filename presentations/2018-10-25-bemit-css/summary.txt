CSS just sucks. Even if you plan to write scalable CSS you end up writing changes to the bottom of a single main.css and suffix your styles with !important. Wouldn't it be great if you can write your CSS like you would build components in complex systems and reuse without duplicated styles? We thought so too! We went down in the trenches and found a solution that we applied to multiple projects. Curious? Go and join us at this techday and learn how to apply it today to your project.
